🔹 <form> tag

What it is:
The <form> tag is used to collect user input and send that data to a server.

👉 Whenever you see:

login pages

signup forms

search boxes

feedback forms

they are made using the <form> tag.

🔹 Basic structure of a form
<form>
  <!-- form elements go here -->
</form>


Inside a form, we usually put:

<input>

<label>

<textarea>

<select>

<button>

🔹 Important attributes of <form>
1️⃣ action

Defines where the form data is sent.

<form action="submit.php">

2️⃣ method

Defines how the data is sent.

Common values:

get → data visible in URL

post → data hidden (more secure)

<form method="post">

🧩 Example
<form action="login.php" method="post">
  <label>Username:</label>
  <input type="text" name="username">

  <label>Password:</label>
  <input type="password" name="password">

  <button type="submit">Login</button>
</form>







------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🔹 <label for="firstName">First Name:</label>

<label> gives a text label for an input field.

for="firstName" connects the label to the input whose id="firstName".

✅ Benefit:

Clicking on “First Name” focuses the input box.

Improves accessibility (screen readers know which label belongs to which input).

🔹 <input type="text">

Creates a text input field.

Used for names, titles, short text, etc.

🔹 name="firstName"

The name of the data sent to the server.

When the form is submitted, data is sent like:

firstName=Jane

🔹 id="firstName"

Gives the input a unique identifier.

Used to:

Connect with <label>

Target with CSS or JavaScript

🔹 placeholder="Jane"

Shows example text inside the input.

Disappears when the user starts typing.

Helps users know what kind of input is expected.

🔹 autocomplete="on"

Allows the browser to suggest previously entered values.

Saves time for the user.

🔹 required

Makes the field mandatory.

The form cannot be submitted if this field is empty.

🔹 autofocus

Automatically places the cursor in this input when the page loads.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🔹 Label
<label for="coffee">Favorite Coffee:</label>


Shows text “Favorite Coffee:” on the page.

for="coffee" connects this label to the select box with id="coffee".

✅ Purpose:
Tells the user what this input is for and helps screen readers.

🔹 Select
<select name="coffee" id="coffee" multiple size="5">


Creates a list of choices.

name="coffee" → this name is sent to the server.

id="coffee" → connects with the label.

multiple → user can select more than one option.

size="5" → shows 5 options at once.

📌 Because of multiple, user can select options using Ctrl / Cmd.

🔹 Optgroup (Coffees)
<optgroup label="Coffees">


Groups related options under the heading “Coffees”.

Makes the list organized and readable.

Inside it:

<option value="regular coffee">Regular Coffee</option>
<option value="iced coffee">Iced Coffee</option>


These are normal coffee choices.

🔹 Optgroup (Espresso Drinks)
<optgroup label="Espresso Drinks">


Groups espresso-based drinks.

Options inside:

<option value="latte" selected>Latte</option>


selected → Latte is chosen by default.

Other options:

Cappuccino

Cortado

Americano

🔹 Option Outside Groups
<option value="other">Other</option>


Not part of any group.

Appears as a separate option.

🧠 Semantic Meaning?

✅ YES

Tag	Why it is semantic
<label>	Describes the input
<select>	Represents a list of choices
<optgroup>	Groups related options
<option>	Represents a selectable value

This helps:

Screen readers

Accessibility

Clean, meaningful HTML

🧾 In one sentence (perfect for exams):

This code creates a multi-select list for choosing favorite coffee types, with grouped options, a default selection, and proper semantic structure.
