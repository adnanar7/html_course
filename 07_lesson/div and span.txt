🔹 <div> tag

What it is:

<div> is a block-level container used to group other HTML elements.

It doesn’t add any meaning to the content (non-semantic).

Often used for layout purposes, styling, or scripting.

Key points:

Block-level → starts on a new line

Can contain multiple elements (text, images, other divs)

Example:

<div class="header">
  <h1>My Website</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my site!</p>
</div>


🧠 Easy way to remember:

<div> = “a big box for grouping stuff”

🔹 <span> tag

What it is:

<span> is an inline container used to wrap small parts of text or elements.

Like <div>, it is non-semantic, just for styling or scripting.

Key points:

Inline → stays in the same line

Usually used for styling a word or part of text

Example:

<p>This is a <span style="color: red;">red word</span> in a sentence.</p>


🧠 Easy way to remember:

<span> = “a small piece of text or element I want to style”
