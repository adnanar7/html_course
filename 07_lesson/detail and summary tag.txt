🔹 <details> tag

What it is:
The <details> tag is used to create a collapsible section of content that the user can show or hide.

By default, the content inside <details> is hidden.

When the user clicks, it expands to show the content.

🔹 <summary> tag

What it is:
The <summary> tag defines a heading or label for the <details> element.

This is the part the user clicks on to expand/collapse the content.

Each <details> can have one <summary>.

🧩 Example
<details>
  <summary>Click to read more</summary>
  <p>This is additional content that is initially hidden. You can expand or collapse it.</p>
</details>


How it works:

“Click to read more” is visible.

The paragraph is hidden until the user clicks the summary.

✅ Key Points

<details> = collapsible container.

<summary> = the clickable heading for that container.
